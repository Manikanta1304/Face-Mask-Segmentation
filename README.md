# Face-Mask-Segmentation

Project: Face mask segmentation

Predict and apply masks over the faces within images using CNN and image recognition algorithms. In this hands-on project, the goal is to build a system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and apply a segmentation mask on the face.

Skills and Tools:
Computer Vision, CNN, Transfer Learning, Object detection

Dataset: 

WIDER Face Dataset

* WIDER FACE dataset is a face detection benchmark dataset, of which images are selected from the publicly available WIDER dataset.
* This data has 32,203 images and 393,703 faces are labelled with a high degree of variability in scale, pose and occlusion as depicted in the sample images.
* In this project, we are using 409 images and around 1000 faces for ease of computation.
